# My Mods for Enter The Gungeon

This repo contains the source code for all my public ETG mods that I uploaded on the modworkshop (https://modworkshop.net/user/59119). I work with a different versioning system so don't expect commits with progress here, I'll simply push the finished work if I update a mod.

The licence is GNU, but I urge you to be reasonable, e.g. there is no need for reuploads without major changes or competing updated versions in case MTG updates. I want this to be public and open source so people can learn a bit from my code, fix it, update it in case I'm gone and because I believe that modding should always be open source.

For more information visit the individual mod page. Have fun guys.
